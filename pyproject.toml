description = "Machine Gnostics is an open-source initiative that seeks to redefine the mathematical underpinnings of machine learning. While most conventional ML libraries are grounded in probabilistic and statistical frameworks, Machine Gnostics explores alternative paradigmsâ€”drawing from deterministic algebra, information theory, and geometric methods. This approach opens new avenues for building robust, interpretable, and reliable analysis tools that can withstand the limitations of traditional models."
