# ManGo: Machine Gnostics

Welcome to ManGo, a Python library implementing Machine Gnostics principles for robust data analysis, modeling, and inference. Unlike traditional statistical approaches that rely on probabilistic assumptions, ManGo leverages deterministic algebraic and geometric structures to provide exceptional resilience to outliers, noise, and corrupted data.

ManGo is an open-source initiative to build a machine learning library that works on alternative mathematical foundations. While conventional ML libraries primarily use probabilistic and statistical methods, ManGo explores the power of deterministic algebraic structures, information theory, and geometric approaches to create more robust analysis tools.

## Overview

ManGo offers a comprehensive suite of tools for robust analysis:

- **Robust Regression Models** ‚Äì Polynomial regression models with gnostic-based weighting for optimal resilience to outliers
- **Gnostic Metrics** ‚Äì Alternative evaluation metrics that provide more reliable performance assessment in the presence of corrupted data
- **Mathematical Gnostics Calculations** ‚Äì Core implementations of gnostic statistics including robust measures of central tendency, dispersion, and correlation

## Key Features

- üõ°Ô∏è **Exceptional Outlier Resistance** ‚Äì Automatically detects and downweights anomalous observations without manual intervention
- üîç **Information-Theoretic Foundation** ‚Äì Based on rigorous mathematical principles rather than probabilistic assumptions
- üîß **Drop-in Replacements** ‚Äì Use gnostic alternatives to common statistical measures like mean, median, correlation
- üìä **MLflow Integration** ‚Äì Seamless model tracking, versioning, and deployment
- üß™ **Scientifically Validated** ‚Äì Tested on real-world problems across multiple domains including thermodynamics, materials science, and engineering
